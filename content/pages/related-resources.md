### Recommended Textbooks

There are three recommended textbooks (not required!) for this course. In addition, we have a number of other suggestions collected over previous years.

*   Katz, Jonathan, and Yehuda Lindell. _Introduction to Modern Cryptography_. Chapman and Hall / CRC, 2007. ISBN: 9781584885511. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=TTtVKHdOcDoC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]
*   Ferguson, Niels, Bruce Schneier, and Tadayoshi Kohno. _Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications_. Wiley, 2010. ISBN: 9780470474242.
*   Paar, Christof, and Jan Pelzl. [_Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners_](http://www.springer.com/computer/security+and+cryptology/book/978-3-642-04100-6). Springer, 2011. ISBN: 9783642041006. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=f24wFELSzkoC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

### Other Suggested Textbooks

*   Stamp, Mark. _Information Security: Principles and Practice_. John Wiley & Sons, 2011. ISBN: 9780470626399. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=UW3SS9P9hdEC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]
*   Menezes, Alfred, Paul van Oorschot, and Scott Vanstone. _Handbook of Applied Cryptography_. CRC Press, 1996. ISBN: 9780849385230. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=MhvcBQAAQBAJ&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    This is a very comprehensive book. The best part is that you can [download this book online](http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/)! The hardcopy is very convenient though.
*   Schneier, Bruce. [_Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C_.](http://www.schneier.com/book-applied.html) 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, 1996. ISBN: 9780471117094.  
    This is the best book to read for an introduction to applied security and cryptography. There is much less math than the book by Menezes et al. Sometimes statements are made without much justification, but no other book even compares to this comprehensive introduction to cryptography. The bibliography alone is worth buying the book.
*   Paar, Christof, and Jan Pelzl. [_Understanding Cryptography__: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners_](http://www.springer.com/computer/security+and+cryptology/book/978-3-642-04100-6). Springer, 2011. ISBN: 9783642041006. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=f24wFELSzkoC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]
*   Anderson, Ross. [_Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems_](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html). John Wiley & Sons, 2001. ISBN: 9780471389224.  
    An excellent book on security in real world systems.
*   Stinson, Douglas. [_Cryptography: Theory and Practice_](https://labs.xjtudlc.com/labs/wldmt1/reading%20list/books/Network%20security%20and%20crypto/Cryptography%20Theory%20and%20Practice.pdf). Chapman and Hall / CRC, 2005. ISBN: 9781584885085. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=uhl_kYfpgo4C&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    This used to be required for 6.875, the theory of cryptography class at MIT.
*   Schneier, Bruce. [_Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World_](http://www.schneier.com/book-sandl.html). John Wiley & Sons, 2004. ISBN: 9780471253112. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=z_7CAjmql6kC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    Schneier used to advocate good cryptography as the solution to security problems. He has since changed his mind. Now he talks about risk management and cost-benefit analysis.
*   Rescorla, Eric. [_SSL and TLS: Designing and Building Secure Systems_](http://www.pearson.ch/1471/9780201615982/SSL-and-TLS-Designing-and-Building.aspx). Addison-Wesley, 2001.  
    The only book you need to read to learn about the evolution, politics, and bugs in the development of SSL. Eric's a swell guy too; buy his book.
*   Neumann, Peter. [_Computer Related Risks_](http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/neumann-book.html). Addison-Wesley Professional, 1994. ISBN: 9780201558050. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=8d-qU8K0BN4C&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    Power grid failures. Train collisions. Primary and backup power lines blowing up simultaneously. These events aren't supposed to happen! Neumann offers a plethora of stories about the risks and consequences of technology, gathered from his [Risks mailing list](http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks). On a side note, Neumann is also responsible for coming up with the pun/name "Unix."
*   Nielsen, Jakob. [_Usability Engineering_](http://www.useit.com/jakob/useengbook.html). Morgan Kaufmann, 1993. ISBN: 9780125184069. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=95As2OF67f0C&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    There are a lot of non-intuitive GUIs out there for security products. Anyone making a security product for use by humans should learn about the principles of smart GUIs.
*   Kaufman, Charlie, Radia Perlman, and Mike Speciner. [_Network Security: Private Communication in a Public World_](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Security-Private-Communication-Public/dp/0130460192). 2nd ed. Prentice Hall, 2002. ISBN: 9780130460196. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=wxMqaz4JMb0C&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    The authors discuss network security from a very applied approach. There is a lot of discussion about real systems, all the way down to the IETF RFCs and the on-the-wire bit representations. The authors also have a fun, informal style.
*   Garfinkel, Simson, and Gene Spafford. [_Web Security, Privacy & Commerce_](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/websec2/). O'Reilly Media, 2001. ISBN: 9780596000455. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=jIBH98wwuv8C&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    It's hard to keep up with all the security software out there. But these authors do a good job documenting it all. Garfinkel was an undergraduate and PhD student at MIT.
*   Kahn, David. _Codebreakers_. Signet, 1973. ISBN: 9780451089670.
*   Hallam-Baker, Phillip. [_The dotCrime Manifesto: How to Stop Internet Crime_](https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1143&context=publication). Addison-Wesley, 2007. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWp-1R_tJGgC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]
*   Smart, Nigel. [_Cryptography: An Introduction_](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~waa/414-F11/IntroToCrypto.pdf)_._ 3rd ed. Mcgraw-Hill College, 2004. ISBN: 9780077099879.
*   Yan, Song Y., and Martin E. Hellman. [_Number Theory for Computing_](http://www.springer.com/computer/foundations/book/978-3-540-43072-8). Springer, 2002. ISBN: 9783540430728. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=lIvPz7k41SEC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]
*   Angluin, Dana. [_Lecture Notes on the Complexity of Some Problems in Number Theory_](http://www.springer.com/computer/foundations/book/978-3-540-43072-8). Yale University, 1982.  
    Chapters 3â€“10 provide relevant number theory for the class.
